about to do it myself!”
“Eet was no trouble,” said Fleur Delacour
, setting the
tray across Harry’
s knees and then swooping to kiss
him on each cheek: He felt the places where her
mouth had touched him burn. “I ’ave been longing to
see ’im. Y
ou remember my seester
, Gabrielle? She

never stops talking about ’Arry Potter
. She will be delighted to see you
again.”
“Oh … is she here too?” Harry croaked.
“No, no, silly boy
,” said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, “I
mean next summer
, when we — but do you not
know?”
Her great blue eyes widened and she looked
reproachfully at Mrs. W
easley
, who said, “W
e hadn’
t
got around to telling him yet.”
Fleur turned back to Harry
, swinging her silvery sheet
of hair so that it whipped Mrs. W
easley across the
face.
“Bill and I are going to be married!”

“Oh,” said Harry blankly
. He could not help noticing
how Mrs. W
easley
, Hermione, and Ginny were all
determinedly avoiding one another
’
s gaze. “W
ow
. Er
— congratulations!”
She swooped down upon him and kissed him again.
“Bill is very busy at ze moment, working very ’ard,
and I only work part-time at Gringotts for my
Eenglish, so he brought me ’ere for a few days to get
to know ’is family properly
. I was so pleased to ’ear
you would be coming — zere isn’
t much to do ’ere,
unless you like cooking and chickens! W
ell — enjoy
your breakfast, ’Arry!”
W
ith these words she turned gracefully and seemed to
float out of the room, closing the door quietly behind
her
.
Mrs. W
easley made a noise that sounded like “tchah!”

“Mum hates her

.
“I do not hate her!” said Mrs. W

whisper
. “I just think they’ve hurried into this
engagement, that’
s all!”
“They’ve known each other a year
,” said Ron, who
looked oddly groggy and was staring at the closed
door
.
“W
ell, that’
s not very long! I know why it’
s happened,
of course. It’
s all this uncertainty with Y
ou-Know-Who
coming back, people think they might be dead
tomorrow
, so they’re rushing all sorts of decisions
they’d normally take time over
. It was the same last
time he was powerful, people eloping left, right, and
center —”
“Including you and Dad,” said Ginny slyly
.
“Y
es, well, your father and I were made for each other
,
what was the point in waiting?” said Mrs. W
easley
.
“Whereas Bill and Fleur … well … what have they
really got in common? He’
s a hardworking, down-to-
earth sort of person, whereas she’
s —”
“A cow
,” said Ginny
, nodding. “But Bill’
s not that
down-to-earth. He’
s a Curse-Breaker
, isn’
t he, he
www.ztcprep.com

likes a bit of adventure, a bit of glamour
. … I expect
that’
s why he’
s gone for Phlegm.”
“Stop calling her that, Ginny
,” said Mrs. W
easley
sharply
, as Harry and Hermione laughed. “W
ell, I’d
better get on. … Eat your eggs while they’re warm,
Harry
.”
Looking careworn, she left the room. Ron still seemed
slightly punch-drunk; he was shaking his head
P a g e

experimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of water
.
“Don’
t you get used to her if she’
s staying in the same
house?” Harry asked.
“W
ell, you do,” said Ron, “but if she jumps out at you
unexpectedly
, like then …”
“It’
s pathetic,” said Hermione furiously
, striding away
from Ron as far as she could go and turning to face
him with her arms folded once she had reached the
wall.
“Y
ou don’
t really want her around forever?” Ginny
www.ztcprep.com

asked Ron incredulously
. When he merely shrugged,
she said, “W
ell, Mum’
s going to put a stop to it if she
can, I bet you anything.”
“How’
s she going to manage that?” asked Harry
.
“She keeps trying to get T
onks round for dinner
. I
think she’
s hoping Bill will fall for T
onks instead. I
hope he does, I’d much rather have her in the family
.”
“Y
eah, that’ll work,” said Ron sarcastically
. “Listen,
no bloke in his right mind’
s going to fancy T
onks
when Fleur
’
s around. I mean, T
onks is okay-looking
when she isn’
t doing stupid things to her hair and her
nose, but —”
“She’
s a damn sight nicer than 
Phlegm, 
’
’ said Ginny
“And she’
s more intelligent, she’
s an Auror!” said
Hermione from the corner
.
“Fleur
’
s not stupid, she was good enough to enter the
T
riwizard T
ournament,” said Harry
.

“Not you as well!” said Hermione bitterly
.
www.ztcprep.com

“I suppose you like the way Phlegm says ‘’Arry
,’ do
you?” asked Ginny scornfully
.
“No,” said Harry
, wishing he hadn’
t spoken, “I was
just saying, Phlegm — I mean, Fleur —”
“I’d much rather have T
onks in the family
,” said
Ginny
. “At least she’
s a laugh.”
“She hasn’
t been much of a laugh lately
,” said Ron.
“Every time I’ve seen her she’
s looked more like
Moaning Myrtle.”
“That’
s not fair
,” snapped Hermione. “She still hasn’
t
got over what happened … you know … I mean, he
was her cousin!”
Harry’
s heart sank. They had arrived at Sirius. He
picked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs
into his mouth, hoping to deflect any invitation to join
in this part of the conversation.
“T
onks and Sirius barely knew each other!” said Ron.
“Sirius was in Azkaban half her life and before that
their families never met —”
“That’
s not the point,” said Hermione. “She thinks it
www.ztcprep.com

was her fault he died!”
“How does she work that one out?” asked Harry
, in
spite of himself.
“W
ell, she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn’
t
she? I think she feels that if only she had finished her
of
f, Bellatrix couldn’
t have killed Sirius.”
“That’
s stupid,” said Ron.

“It’
s survivor
’
s guilt,” said Hermione. “I know Lupin’
s tried to talk her
round, but she’
s still really down.
She’
s actually having trouble with her
Metamorphosing!”
“W
ith her — ?”
“She can’
t change her appearance like she used to,”
explained Hermione. “I think her powers must have
been af
fected by shock, or something.”
“I didn’
t know that could happen,” said Harry
.
“Nor did I,” said Hermione, “but I suppose if you’re
really depressed …”
The door opened again and Mrs. W
easley popped her
www.ztcprep.com

head in. “Ginny
,” she whispered, “come downstairs
and help me with the lunch.”
“I’m talking to this lot!” said Ginny
, outraged.
“Now!” said Mrs. W
easley
, and withdrew
.
“She only wants me there so she doesn’
t have to be
alone with Phlegm!” said Ginny crossly
. She swung
her long red hair around in a very good imitation of
Fleur and pranced across the room with her arms
held aloft like a ballerina.
“Y
ou lot had better come down quickly too,” she said
as she left.
Harry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat
more breakfast. Hermione was peering into Fred and
Geor
ge’
s boxes, though every now and then she cast
sideways looks at Harry
. Ron, who was now helping
himself to Harry’
s toast, was still gazing dreamily at
the door
.

“What’
s this?” Hermione asked eventually
, holding up what looked like a
small telescope.
www.ztcprep.com

“Dunno,” said Ron, “but if Fred and Geor
ge’ve left it
here, it’
s probably not ready for the joke shop yet, so
be careful.”
“Y
our mum said the shop’
s going well,” said Harry
.
“Said Fred and Geor
ge have got a real flair for
business.”
“That’
s an understatement,” said Ron. “They’re raking
in the Galleons! I can’
t wait to see the place, we
haven’
t been to Diagon Alley yet, because Mum says
Dad’
s got to be there for extra security and he’
s been
really busy at work, but it sounds excellent.”
“And what about Percy?” asked Harry; the third-
eldest W
easley brother had fallen out with the rest of
the family
. “Is he talking to your mum and dad
again?”
“Nope,” said Ron.
“But he knows your dad was right all along now
about V
oldemort being back —”
“Dumbledore says people find it far easier to for
give
others for being wrong than being right,” said
www.ztcprep.com

Hermione. “I heard him telling your mum, Ron.”
“Sounds like the sort of mental thing Dumbledore
would say
,” said Ron.
“He’
s going to be giving me private lessons this year
,”
said Harry conversationally
.
Ron choked on his bit of toast, and Hermione gasped.
P a g e

“Y
ou kept that quiet!” said Ron.
“I only just remembered,” said Harry honestly
. “He
told me last night in your broom shed.”
“Blimey … private lessons with Dumbledore!” said
Ron, looking impressed. “I wonder why he’
s … ?”
His voice tailed away
. Harry saw him and Hermione
exchange looks. Harry laid down his knife and fork,
his heart beating rather fast considering that all he
was doing was sitting in bed. Dumbledore had said to
do it. … Why not now? He fixed his eyes on his fork,
which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his
lap, and said, “I don’
t know exactly why he’
s going to
www.ztcprep.com

be giving me lessons, but I think it must be because
of the prophecy
.”
Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke. Harry had the
impression that both had frozen. He continued, still
speaking to his fork, “Y
ou know
, the one they were
trying to steal at the Ministry
.”
“Nobody knows what it said, though,” said Hermione
quickly
. “It got smashed.”
“Although the 
Pr
ophet
 says —” began Ron, but
Hermione said, “Shh!”
“The 
Pr
ophet’
s
 got it right,” said Harry
, looking up at
them both with a great ef
fort: Hermione seemed
frightened and Ron amazed. “That glass ball that
smashed wasn’
t the only record of the prophecy
. I
heard the whole thing in Dumbledore’
s of
fice, he was
the one the prophecy was made to, so he could tell
me. From what it said,” Harry took a deep breath, “it
looks like I’m the one who’
s got to finish of
f
V
oldemort. … At least, it said neither of us could live
while the other survives.”

The three of them gazed at one another in silence for a moment. Then there
was a loud bang and Hermione
vanished behind a puf
f of black smoke.
“Hermione!” shouted Harry and Ron; the breakfast
tray slid to the floor with a crash.
Hermione emer
ged, coughing, out of the smoke,
clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly
purple black eye.
“I squeezed it and it — it punched me!” she gasped.
And sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long
spring protruding from the end of the telescope.
“Don’
t worry
,” said Ron, who was plainly trying not to
laugh, “Mum’ll fix that, she’
s good at healing minor
injuries —”
“Oh well, never mind that now!” said Hermione
hastily
. “Harry
, oh, Harry …”
She sat down on the edge of his bed again.
“W
e wondered, after we got back from the Ministry …
Obviously
, we didn’
t want to say anything to you, but
www.ztcprep.com

from what Lucius Malfoy said about the prophecy
,
how it was about you and V
oldemort, well, we
thought it might be something like this. … Oh, Harry
…” She stared at him, then whispered, “Are you
scared?”
“Not as much as I was,” said Harry
. “When I first
heard it, I was … but now
, it seems as though I
always knew I’d have to face him in the end. …”
“When we heard Dumbledore was collecting you in
person, we thought he might be telling you something
P a g e

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
or showing you something to do with the prophecy
,”
said Ron eagerly
. “And we were kind of right, weren’
t
we? He wouldn’
t be giving you lessons if he thought
you were a goner
, wouldn’
t waste his time — he must
think you’ve got a chance!”
“That’
s true,” said Hermione. “I wonder what he’ll
teach you, Harry? Really advanced defensive magic,
probably … powerful countercurses … anti-jinxes …”
www.ztcprep.com

Harry did not really listen. A warmth was spreading
through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight;
a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be
dissolving. He knew that Ron and Hermione were
more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere
fact that they were still there on either side of him,
speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking
from him as though he were contaminated or
dangerous, was worth more than he could ever tell
them.
“… and evasive enchantments generally
,” concluded
Hermione. “W
ell, at least you know one lesson you’ll
be having this year
, that’
s one more than Ron and
me. I wonder when our O.W
.L. results will come?”
“Can’
t be long now
, it’
s been a month,” said Ron.
“Hang on,” said Harry
, as another part of last night’
s
conversation came back to him. “I think Dumbledore
said our O.W
.L. results would be arriving today!”
“T
oday?” shrieked Hermione. “
T
oday
? But why didn’
t
you — oh my God — you should have said —”
www.ztcprep.com

She leapt to her feet.
“I’m going to see whether any owls have come. …”

But when Harry arrived downstairs ten minutes later
, fully dressed and
carrying his empty breakfast tray
, it
was to find Hermione sitting at the kitchen table in
great agitation, while Mrs. W
easley tried to lessen her
resemblance to half a panda.
“It just won’
t budge,” Mrs. W
easley was saying
anxiously
, standing over Hermione with her wand in
her hand and a copy of 
The
 
Healer
’
s Helpmate
 open at
“Bruises, Cuts, and Abrasions.” “This has always
worked before, I just can’
t understand it.”
“It’ll be Fred and Geor

s idea of a funny joke,
making sure it can’
t come of
f,” said Ginny
“But it’
s got to come of

t
go around looking like this forever!”
“Y

t, dear
, we’ll find an antidote, don’
t worry

said Mrs. W
easley soothingly
.
“Bill told me ’ow Fred and Geor
ge are very amusing!”

said Fleur
, smiling serenely
.
“Y
es, I can hardly breathe for laughing,” snapped
Hermione.
She jumped up and started walking round and round
the kitchen, twisting her fingers together
.
“Mrs. W
easley
, you’re quite, quite sure no owls have
arrived this morning?”
“Y
es, dear
, I’d have noticed,” said Mrs. W
easley
patiently
. “But it’
s barely nine, there’
s still plenty of
time. …”
“I know I messed up Ancient Runes,” muttered
Hermione feverishly
, “I definitely made at least one

serious mistranslation. And the Defense Against the Dark Arts practical was
no good at all. I thought
T
ransfiguration went all right at the time, but looking
back —”
“Hermione, will you shut up, you’re not the only one
who’
s nervous!” barked Ron. “And when you’ve got
your eleven ‘Outstanding’ O.W
