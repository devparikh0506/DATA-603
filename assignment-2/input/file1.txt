very briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of the
chairs in front of the desk.
“Dif
ficult to know where to begin,” muttered Fudge,
pulling up the chair
, sitting down, and placing his
green bowler upon his knees. “What a week, what a
week …”
“Had a bad one too, have you?” asked the Prime
Minister stif
fly
, hoping to convey by this that he had

quite enough on his plate already without any extra
helpings from Fudge.
“Y
es, of course,” said Fudge, rubbing his eyes wearily
and looking morosely at the Prime Minister
. “I’ve been
having the same week you have, Prime Minister
. The
Brockdale Bridge … the Bones and V
ance murders …
not to mention the ruckus in the W
est Country …”
“Y
ou — er — your — I mean to say
, some of your
people were — were involved in those — those things,
were they?”

Fudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern
look. “Of course they were,” he said. “Surely you’ve
realized what’
s going on?”
“I …” hesitated the Prime Minister
.
It was precisely this sort of behavior that made him
dislike Fudge’
s visits so much. He was, after all, the
Prime Minister and did not appreciate being made to
feel like an ignorant schoolboy
. But of course, it had
been like this from his very first meeting with Fudge
on his very first evening as Prime Minister
. He
remembered it as though it were yesterday and knew
it would haunt him until his dying day
.
He had been standing alone in this very of
fice,
savoring the triumph that was his after so many
years of dreaming and scheming, when he had heard
a cough behind him, just like tonight, and turned to
find that ugly little portrait talking to him,
announcing that the Minister of Magic was about to
arrive and introduce himself.
Naturally
, he had thought that the long campaign and
www.ztcprep.com

the strain of the election had caused him to go mad.
He had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking
P a g e 
| 6
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
to him, though this had been nothing to how he felt
when a self-proclaimed wizard had bounced out of the
fireplace and shaken his hand. He had remained
speechless throughout Fudge’
s kindly explanation
that there were witches and wizards still living in
secret all over the world and his reassurances that he
was not to bother his head about them as the
Ministry of Magic took responsibility for the whole
W
izarding community and prevented the non-magical
population from getting wind of them. It was, said
Fudge, a dif
ficult job that encompassed everything
from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to
keeping the dragon population under control (the
Prime Minister remembered clutching the desk for
support at this point). Fudge had then patted the
shoulder of the still-dumbstruck Prime Minister in a
www.ztcprep.com

fatherly sort of way
.
“Not to worry
,” he had said, “it’
s odds-on you’ll never
see me again. I’ll only bother you if there’
s something
really serious going on our end, something that’
s
likely to af
fect the Muggles — the non-magical
population, I should say
. Otherwise, it’
s live and let
live. And I must say
, you’re taking it a lot better than
your predecessor
. 
He
 tried to throw me out the
window
, thought I was a hoax planned by the
opposition.”
At this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last.
“Y
ou’re — you’re 
not
 a hoax, then?”
It had been his last, desperate hope.
“No,” said Fudge gently
. “No, I’m afraid I’m not. Look.”
And he had turned the Prime Minister
’
s teacup into a
gerbil.
P a g e 
| 7
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“But,” said the Prime Minister breathlessly
, watching his teacup chewing on
the corner of his next speech,
“but why — why has nobody told me — ?”
www.ztcprep.com

“The Minister of Magic only reveals him- or herself to
the Muggle Prime Minister of the day
,” said Fudge,
poking his wand back inside his jacket. “W
e find it
the best way to maintain secrecy
.”
“But then,” bleated the Prime Minister
, “why hasn’
t a
former Prime Minister warned me — ?”
At this, Fudge had actually laughed.
“My dear Prime Minister
, are 
you
 ever going to tell
anybody?”
Still chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into
the fireplace, stepped into the emerald flames, and
vanished with a whooshing sound. The Prime
Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and
realized that he would never
, as long as he lived, dare
mention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the
wide world would believe him?
The shock had taken a little while to wear of
f. For a
time, he had tried to convince himself that Fudge had
indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of
sleep during his grueling election campaign. In a vain
www.ztcprep.com

attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this
uncomfortable encounter
, he had given the gerbil to
his delighted niece and instructed his private
secretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little
man who had announced Fudge’
s arrival. T
o the
Prime Minister
’
s dismay
, however
, the portrait had
proved impossible to remove. When several
carpenters, a builder or two, an art historian, and the
Chancellor of the Exchequer had all tried
unsuccessfully to prise it from the wall, the Prime
P a g e 
| 8
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
Minister had abandoned the attempt and simply
resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless
and silent for the rest of his term in of
fice.
Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the
corner of his eye the occupant of the painting
yawning, or else scratching his nose; even, once or
twice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving
nothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas behind.
www.ztcprep.com

However
, he had trained himself not to look at the
picture very much, and always to tell himself firmly
that his eyes were playing tricks on him when
anything like this happened.
Then, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the
Prime Minister had been alone in his of
fice when the
portrait had once again announced the imminent
arrival of Fudge, who had burst out of the fireplace,
sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic.
Before the Prime Minister could ask why he was
dripping all over the Axminster
, Fudge had started
ranting about a prison the Prime Minister had never
heard of, a man named “Serious” Black, something
that sounded like “Hogwarts,” and a boy called Harry
Potter
, none of which made the remotest sense to the
Prime Minister
.
“… I’ve just come from Azkaban,” Fudge had panted,
tipping a lar
ge amount of water out of the rim of his
bowler hat into his pocket. “Middle of the North Sea,
you know
, nasty flight … the dementors are in
www.ztcprep.com

uproar” — he shuddered — “they’ve never had a
breakout before. Anyway
, I had to come to you, Prime
Minister
. Black’
s a known Muggle killer and may be
planning to rejoin Y
ou-Know-Who. … But of course,
you don’
t even know who Y
ou-Know-Who is!” He had
gazed hopelessly at the Prime Minister for a moment,
then said, “W
ell, sit down, sit down, I’d better fill you
in. … Have a whiskey …”
P a g e

The Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit down in his own of
fice,
let alone of
fered his own
whiskey
, but he sat nevertheless. Fudge pulled out
his wand, conjured two lar
ge glasses full of amber
liquid out of thin air
, pushed one of them into the
Prime Minister
’
s hand, and drew up a chair
.
Fudge had talked for more than an hour
. At one
point, he had refused to say a certain name aloud and
wrote it instead on a piece of parchment, which he
had thrust into the Prime Minister
’
s whiskey-free
hand. When at last Fudge had stood up to leave, the
www.ztcprep.com

Prime Minister had stood up too.
“So you think that …” He had squinted down at the
name in his left hand. “Lord V
ol —”
“
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
!” snarled Fudge.
“I’m sorry
. … Y
ou think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-
Named is still alive, then?”
“W
ell, Dumbledore says he is,” said Fudge, as he had
fastened his pin-striped cloak under his chin, “but
we’ve never found him. If you ask me, he’
s not
dangerous unless he’
s got support, so it’
s Black we
ought to be worrying about. Y
ou’ll put out that
warning, then? Excellent. W
ell, I hope we don’
t see
each other again, Prime Minister! Good night.”
But they had seen each other again. Less than a year
later a harassed-looking Fudge had appeared out of
thin air in the cabinet room to inform the Prime
Minister that there had been a spot of bother at the
Kwidditch (or that was what it had sounded like)
W
orld Cup and that several Muggles had been
“involved,” but that the Prime Minister was not to
www.ztcprep.com

worry
, the fact that Y
ou-Know-Who’
s Mark had been
seen again meant nothing; Fudge was sure it was an
P a g e 
| 10
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
isolated incident, and the Muggle Liaison Of
fice was dealing with all
memory modifications as they spoke.
“Oh, and I almost for
got,” Fudge had added. “W
e’re
importing three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the
T
riwizard T
ournament, quite routine, but the
Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical
Creatures tells me that it’
s down in the rule book that
we have to notify you if we’re bringing highly
dangerous creatures into the country
.”
“I — what — 
dragons
?” spluttered the Prime Minister
.
“Y
es, three,” said Fudge. “And a sphinx. W
ell, good
day to you.”
The Prime Minister had hoped beyond hope that
dragons and sphinxes would be the worst of it, but
no. Less than two years later
, Fudge had erupted out
of the fire yet again, this time with the news that
there had been a mass breakout from Azkaban.
www.ztcprep.com

“A 
mass
 breakout?” repeated the Prime Minister
hoarsely
.
“No need to worry
, no need to worry!” shouted Fudge,
already with one foot in the flames. “W
e’ll have them
rounded up in no time — just thought you ought to
know!”
And before the Prime Minister could shout, “Now
, wait
just one moment!” Fudge had vanished in a shower of
green sparks.
Whatever the press and the opposition might say
, the
Prime Minister was not a foolish man. It had not
escaped his notice that, despite Fudge’
s assurances
at their first meeting, they were now seeing rather a
lot of each other
, nor that Fudge was becoming more
P a g e

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
flustered with each visit. Little though he liked to think about the Minister
of Magic (or
, as he always
called Fudge in his head, the 
Other
 Minister), the
Prime Minister could not help but fear that the next
time Fudge appeared it would be with graver news
www.ztcprep.com

still. The sight, therefore, of Fudge stepping out of the
fire once more, looking disheveled and fretful and
sternly surprised that the Prime Minister did not
know exactly why he was there, was about the worst
thing that had happened in the course of this
extremely gloomy week.
“How should I know what’
s going on in the — er —
W
izarding community?” snapped the Prime Minister
now
. “I have a country to run and quite enough
concerns at the moment without —”
“W
e have the same concerns,” Fudge interrupted.
“The Brockdale Bridge didn’
t wear out. That wasn’
t
really a hurricane. Those murders were not the work
of Muggles. And Herbert Chorley’
s family would be
safer without him. W
e are currently making
arrangements to have him transferred to St. Mungo’
s
Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. The move
should be ef
fected tonight.”
“What do you … I’m afraid I … 
What
?” blustered the
Prime Minister
.
www.ztcprep.com

Fudge took a great, deep breath and said, “Prime
Minister
, I am very sorry to have to tell you that he’
s
back. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back.”
“Back? When you say ‘back’ … he’
s alive? I mean —”
The Prime Minister groped in his memory for the
details of that horrible conversation of three years
previously
, when Fudge had told him about the
wizard who was feared above all others, the wizard
P a g e 
| 12
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
who had committed a thousand terrible crimes before his mysterious
disappearance fifteen years earlier
.
“Y
es, alive,” said Fudge. “That is — I don’
t know — is
a man alive if he can’
t be killed? I don’
t really
understand it, and Dumbledore won’
t explain
properly — but anyway
, he’
s certainly got a body and
is walking and talking and killing, so I suppose, for
the purposes of our discussion, yes, he’
s alive.”
The Prime Minister did not know what to say to this,
but a persistent habit of wishing to appear well-
informed on any subject that came up made him cast
www.ztcprep.com

around for any details he could remember of their
previous conversations.
“Is Serious Black with — er — He-Who-Must-Not-Be-
Named?”
“Black? Black?” said Fudge distractedly
, turning his
bowler rapidly in his fingers. “Sirius Black, you
mean? Merlin’
s beard, no. Black’
s dead. T
urns out we
were — er — mistaken about Black. He was innocent
after all. And he wasn’
t in league with He-Who-Must-
Not-Be-Named either
. I mean,” he added defensively
,
spinning the bowler hat still faster
, “all the evidence
pointed — we had more than fifty eyewitnesses — but
anyway
, as I say
, he’
s dead. Murdered, as a matter of
fact. On Ministry of Magic premises. There’
s going to
be an inquiry
, actually
. …”
T
o his great surprise, the Prime Minister felt a fleeting
stab of pity for Fudge at this point. It was, however
,
eclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at
the thought that, deficient though he himself might
be in the area of materializing out of fireplaces, there
www.ztcprep.com

had never been a murder in any of the government
departments under 
his
 char
ge. … Not yet, anyway …
P a g e

While the Prime Minister surreptitiously touched the wood of his desk,
Fudge continued, “But Black’
s by-the-by now
. The point is, we’re at war
,
Prime Minister
,
and steps must be taken.”
“At war?” repeated the Prime Minister nervously
.
“Surely that’
s a little bit of an overstatement?”
“He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has now been joined by
those of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in
January
,” said Fudge, speaking more and more
rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a
lime-green blur
. “Since they have moved into the
open, they have been wreaking havoc. The Brockdale
Bridge — he did it, Prime Minister
, he threatened a
mass Muggle killing unless I stood aside for him and
—”
“Good grief, so it’
s 
your
 fault those people were killed
and I’m having to answer questions about rusted
www.ztcprep.com

rigging and corroded expansion joints and I don’
t
know what else!” said the Prime Minister furiously
.
“
My
 fault!” said Fudge, coloring up. “Are you saying
you would have caved in to blackmail like that?”
“Maybe not,” said the Prime Minister
, standing up
and striding about the room, “but I would have put all
my ef
forts into catching the blackmailer before he
committed any such atrocity!”
“Do you really think I wasn’
t already making every
ef
fort?” demanded Fudge heatedly
. “Every Auror in
the Ministry was — and is — trying to find him and
round up his followers, but we happen to be talking
about one of the most powerful wizards of all time, a
wizard who has eluded capture for almost three
decades!”
P a g e

“So I suppose you’re going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the W
est
Country too?” said the Prime
Minister
, his temper rising with every pace he took. It
was infuriating to discover the reason for all these
www.ztcprep.com

terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public,
almost worse than it being the government’
s fault
after all.
“That was no hurricane,” said Fudge miserably
.
“Excuse me!” barked the Prime Minister
, now
positively stamping up and down. “T
rees uprooted,
roofs ripped of
f, lampposts bent, horrible injuries —”
“It was the Death Eaters,” said Fudge. “He-Who-Must-
Not-Be-Named’
s followers. And … and we suspect
giant involvement.”
The Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though
he had hit an invisible wall. “
What
 involvement?”
Fudge grimaced. “He used giants last time, when he
wanted to go for the grand ef
fect,” he said. “The Of
fice
of Misinformation has been working around the clock,
we’ve had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify
the memories of all the Muggles who saw what really
happened, we’ve got most of the Department for the
Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running
around Somerset, but we can’
t find the giant — it’

been a disaster
.”
“Y
ou don’
t say!” said the Prime Minister furiously
.
“I won’
t deny that morale is pretty low at the
Ministry
,” said Fudge. “What with all that, and then
losing Amelia Bones.”
“Losing who?”

“Amelia Bones. Head of the Department of Magical
Law Enforcement. W

she was a very gifted witch and — and all the
evidence was that she put up a real fight.”
Fudge cleared his throat and, with an ef
fort, it
seemed, stopped spinning his bowler hat.
“But that murder was in the newspapers,” said the
Prime Minister
, momentarily diverted from his anger
.
